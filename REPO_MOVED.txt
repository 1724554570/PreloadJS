The PreloadJS repository has moved to:
http://github.com/CreateJS/PreloadJS/

You will need to update your remote URI. You can do that using this GIT command:
git remote set-url origin git://github.com/CreateJS/PreloadJS.git

If you are using a GIT client UI, check its documentation to learn how to edit the remote path.
